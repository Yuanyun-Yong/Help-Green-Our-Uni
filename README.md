Storyline:
- The player's character is at a landfill where the new trash has come in 
- There'll be different types of trash, with different methods used to deal with them
- Solutions:
 - Throwing recyclable plastic/materials into the recyclables
 - Food waste into composte
 - etc. (Need more research)

- Point System:
 - Every right throw will add a point

- Meant to be a short game, 2 minutes tops
- Arrow keys as the control, using arrow keys to indicate which pile to throw the trash in 
- At the end, give bullet points with statistics for waste management, initiatives by Help Green Our Uni if they're interested in reading

Storyline:
- Player's character in a landfill where the proportional amount of trash University of Auckland produces arrives (As well as how much is being wasted, i.e. paper being thrown into general waste etc.)
- Player then has to sort out trash to ensure that they are not wasted
- Each time a player plays, there will be overall statistics showing how much trash has been sorted, to show how much trash can be recycled as well as how everyone can help contribute by throwing things in their respective categories
 - Statistics: 
  - How much more trash to go
   - Note that the total amount of trash is the total amount of trash (general waste) the university creates every year
  - How many people have sorted the trash
  - How much money (and time) has been spent on sorting the trash so far (Maybe, maybe not)
  - Current score of the user
  - Timer
- Probably combine the two ideas together???
- End of the game:
 - Show the user's final score, and the current highest score
