# Game detailing environment facts
/*
Game description/ basic format:
- 2D
- Unity
 - C# (For scripting) 
 - Based on the Spaceshooter game tutorial
 - Links:
  - https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter-tutorial
  - Rest of the links on the actual page 
- Points for answering "questions" correctly

Environment:
- University of Auckland (City Campus)

Gameplay:
- Questions will be based on initiatives University of Auckland has started
- Statistics/facts about waste, energy usage etc.
 - An add-on/expansion might be to cover University of Auckland
- Questions "stored" within the asteroids:
 - Break one to get a question and find the answer
 - Answer would "come in" debris of the asteroid
  - i.e. Parts of the rock and there would be numbers on them
  - Note that the questions are short questions about statistics
 - Questions are based on facts on Auckland University
 - Space shooter?
  - Maybe not
  - 

Aim: To allow players to learn about environmental issues in a fun and engaging way.

- Player is at a landfill and is being chased by scary trash monsters!
 - Each take down of the monster will lead to there being questions about waste

Storyline:
- Player's character in a landfill where the proportional amount of trash University of Auckland produces arrives (As well as how much is being wasted, i.e. paper being thrown into general waste etc.)
- Player then has to sort out trash to ensure that they are not wasted
 - Throwing recyclable plastic/materials into the recyclables
 - Food waste into composte etc. (Need more research)
- Each time a player plays, there will be overall statistics showing how much trash has been sorted, to show how much trash can be recycled as well as how everyone can help contribute by throwing things in their respective categories
- Statistics:
 - How much more trash to go
 - Note that the total amount of trash is the total amount of trash (general waste) the university creates every year
 - How many people have sorted the trash
 - How much money (and time) has been spent on sorting the trash so far (Maybe, maybe not)
 - Current score of the user
 - Timer
-End of the game:
-Show the user's final score, and the current highest score
- Arrow keys as the control, using arrow keys to indicate which pile to throw the trash in
- At the end, give bullet points with statistics for waste management, initiatives by Help Green Our Uni if they're interested in reading
- Also put the names of some organisations in University of Auckland or Auckland in general if they are interested

3D Game showing how a waste audit actually works?
- Have different environments to highlight different hazards

- Maybe a satellite, over Earth
  - Zoom in over Earth, NZ, Auckland, UoA
  - Show the pollution and landfills
 - Maybe have the player move a landfill vehicle around sorting out the trash?
  - Or not, since having a landfill compaction vehicle would not allow for finer sorting
  - Maybe set it up like a waste audit?
   - Have the scene start out at aa landfill, then take the approximate amount of trash needed for a waste audit (i.e. 8 trash bags?) and have them see the comparative difference
   - Then move onto another scene where the game actually starts
    - In this scene, there would be a flatsheet, where the trash bags are located
    - Recycle bins
    - Protective Gear (to put on)
    - Weighing scale
 - Use statistics from Auckland University
  - 2006: 36% of recyclables sent to the landfill - down to 12% in 2015
   - Increase in relative portion of the food waste though
  - 
  

 Gameplay:
- Arrows as controls/ WASD?
- Space to pick up and drop off trash?
